## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables/coefficients that provide a non-random amount of variance in reguards to the mpg values are "vehicle_length", "vehicle_weight", and "ground_clearance", as well as Intercept, shown on the below image. Also also exhibited by the data, you can reject the hypothesis that the slope is equal to 0. You can assume this by the fact that the R-squared is 0.7149, and the P-value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than the R-squared value. Our data has a decent predictability at 0.71 for MechaCar prototypes, however, it's not perfect. Looking at the data, we only have "ground_clearance" and "vehicle length" as statistically significant predictors ("vehicle_weight" can be considered as well, but to a lesser degree.) This current model can decently predict the current results, but in the future if this data changes, it's not guarenteed to predict the future results, because the variables only show some of the variation in the mpg.
